hostprio		[DEVICE, DRIVER-SPECIFIC]
			Configure the traffic class which will be used for
			management (link-local) traffic injected and trapped
			to/from the CPU. This includes STP, PTP, LLDP etc, as
			well as hardware-specific meta frames with RX
			timestamps.  Higher is better as long as you care about
			your PTP frames.
			Configuration mode: runtime
			Type: u8. 0-7 valid.

best_effort_vlan_filtering
			[DEVICE, DRIVER-SPECIFIC]
			Allow plain ETH_P_8021Q headers to be used as DSA tags.
			Benefits:
			- Can terminate untagged traffic over switch net
			  devices even when enslaved to a bridge with
			  vlan_filtering=1.
			- Can do QoS based on VLAN PCP for autonomously
			  forwarded frames.
			Drawbacks:
			- User cannot change pvid via 'bridge' commands. This
			  would break source port identification on RX for
			  untagged traffic.
			- User cannot use VLANs in range 1024-3071. If the
			  switch receives frames with such VIDs, it will
			  misinterpret them as DSA tags.
			- Cannot terminate VLAN-tagged traffic on local device.
			  There is no way to deduce the source port from these.
			  One could still use the DSA master though.
			- Switch uses Shared VLAN Learning (FDB lookup uses
			  only DMAC as key).
			Configuration mode: runtime
			Type: bool.
